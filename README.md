🛒 ShoppyGlobe E-commerce App
Hello! This is my ShoppyGlobe project. I built this using React and Vite to create a fun and easy-to-use shopping website.

🚀 What this project does:
Shows Products: It fetches a list of cool items from an API.

Search: You can type in the search bar to find exactly what you want.

View Details: You can click on any item to see more information about it.

Shopping Cart: You can add items to your cart, change the quantity, or remove them if you change your mind.

Checkout: A simple form to "buy" your items and see an order summary.

🛠️ Tools I used:
React: To build the user interface using components.

Redux Toolkit: To manage the "brain" of the app (the cart and search state).

React Router: To move between the Home, Cart, and Checkout pages.

Vite: To make the development fast and smooth.

CSS: To make everything look nice and work on mobile phones.

📂 How I organized the code:
src/components: All my UI parts like the Header, Product Items, and Cart.

src/utils: My Redux "slices" and my custom hook for fetching data.

src/App.jsx: The main layout of the website.

src/main.jsx: Where the whole app starts.

📖 How to run this project:
Download or clone the folder.

Open your terminal in the folder.

Type npm install to get all the tools.

Type npm run dev to start the website!

📝 My Learning Journey:
While building this, I learned how to use useEffect to get data from the internet and how useSelector helps the components "see" what is inside the Redux store. I also used React.lazy to make the website load faster!
